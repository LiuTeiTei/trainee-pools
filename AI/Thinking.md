> Perhaps OpenAI [concealed o1's chain of thought](https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/openai-o1-a-new-paradigm-for-ai?open=false#§a-black-box-inside-another-black-box) not just for competitive reasons but because they arrived at a dark realization: it would be unsettling for us to witness an AI leap from English to other languages mid-sentence, then to symbols, and finally to what seems like gibberish, only to land on the correct answer; “What the hell happened? How did you find that answer? I didn’t understand anything!!”

抛开 SFT 人类矫正训练出来的 AI 其推理过程可能对人类并不友好，没有证据证明人类思维是最好的思维，而没有人类思维校准训练出来的 AI 是趋向于最好的思维的。

因此可能就会出现推理过程我们人类并不能理解，出现科幻片里比人来更智慧的 AI 生物。
